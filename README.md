# Hangman

Hangman is a guessing game where one player (could be a computer) thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other player(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. 

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, where each dash is a letter of the secret word that has to be guessed. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter or number does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure (head, hand, leg, etc.)

Standard ways of how the game ends is:
a) if the guesser makes enough incorrect guesses to allow a hangman figure to be completed, then the game is over, with the guesser losing. 
b) if the guesser ends up guessing all the letters or numbers that appears in the word, thereby completing the word, before the stick figure is completed - the game is considered over and guesser is proclaimed a winner. 

A non-standard way of how the game may end is that the player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins. Otherwise, the guesser is penalized the same way as if he have guessed a wrong letter and the game continues.
